    testimony: "Daniel led a team that created a website for my professional partner, an independent artist. From the very start, Daniel began by asking excellent questions and, most importantly, listening. He showed incredible empathy for the client and found the perfect balance between involving the client in the process and making effective use of the client's extremely limited time. Daniel communicated effectively throughout and came to meetings prepared to present progress and ask for any necessary input. One of the most memorable examples of Daniel's client-centered approach was that he selected color palates based on photos of the artist that he had studied. Beyond colors, the entire design of the site reflected the complex and emotional journey that the artist has had to this point in a way that neither of us had ever seen or even conceived. Telling one's life story in one website is a daunting task, but Daniel embraced and led the process in a way that was empowering for the client and yielded outstanding results."
